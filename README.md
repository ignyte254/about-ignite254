# about-ignyte254
**ignyte254** which was founded on **4th March 2019**, is a student run tech community based in Chuka University, Tharaka Nithi County, Kenya.<br/>
Our community is made of members with a desire to leverage their software development skills with the currently used technologies in the tech industry.<br/>

##Shared Struggle
There is a huge disconnect between the technologies taught in school and what is used in the tech industry. Existing tech clubs in some institutions around under-developed areas experience challenges in trying to deal with the issue. Having avenues where people can receive foundation or direction on how to use these technologies is a plus.

## Mission
To provide knowledge and guidance on the active and emerging technologies in the tech industry.

## Vision
Collaborate with established tech clubs to provide tech-avenues for growth in institutions around under-developed areas.

## Avenues of technical growth
- workshops
- Talks
- Hackathons
- Open source campaigns.
- Tech events or workshops with at-least 1 industry expert holding a talk.
- Internship and volunteering campaigns.
- Minunities ( This is an avenue that connects members according to their home origins by grouping and connecting them to tech communities in their hometowns during their holidays)

## Resources we need
- Mentors - to offer direction to members interested in different fields.<br/>
- Creative materials such as blank papers,manilla papers and scissors inorder to create promotional content. This extends to stickers and branded shirts for swag.<br/>
- Equipment such as a projector,repair kits and a public sound system.<br/>
- Funds for food and refreshments.

<br/><br/>If you wish to partner with us in any way (even in ways not covered above), kindly reach out to us on ignyte254@gmail.com
